# Stonkify

Sandbox python web app for stock data visualization

This applet utilizes both the [pandas data reader](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Finnhub API](https://finnhub.io/dashboard). The dashboard was written using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com) & [Plotly](https://plotly.com).

Running `python stonks.py` from the command line should set up the local server for our dashboard. You can then enter the local address into a browser to view the dashboard. From there, you can enter the ticker symbol of any stock into the search field to view
